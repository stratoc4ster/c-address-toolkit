## Overview

The C-Address Toolkit addresses a critical gap in Stellar's onboarding infrastructure: the inability to fund C-addresses (smart wallet addresses) directly without first creating a traditional G-address.

### Components

1. **C-Address Funding SDK** - TypeScript + Python libraries for direct C-address funding
2. **Reference Wallet** - Production-grade web app demonstrating onboarding flows
3. **Onboarding Standards** - Documentation + SEP draft for ecosystem adoption
4. **Integration Examples** - Exchange, fiat on-ramp, and AI agent integration samples
