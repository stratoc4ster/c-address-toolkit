# Checkpoints

## Overview

Checkpoints are internal verification gates before submitting each tranche for SCF review. They ensure deliverables meet success criteria and evidence is prepared.

## Pre-Submission Checkpoint Process

1. **Self-Review** - Lead verifies all deliverables against success criteria
2. **Contractor Review** - Each contractor confirms their work is complete
3. **Evidence Gathering** - Collect all links, screenshots, videos
4. **Demo Test** - Run through demo flow end-to-end
5. **Documentation Check** - Verify all docs are current
6. **Form Preparation** - Draft submission form content
7. **Final Review** - 24-hour cooling period before submit
